Long Intro

Exercise introduction and room layout for mass pairing
exercise at /dev/winter 2016

We find that doing small exercises is valuable for learning and that programming together is
the best way to network for developers - what better way to get to know
each other and have fun than write some code together.

## A game of pacman

You'll develop a bit of the game of Pacman - with tests if you can, exploring if you can't or don't want to.

[Pacman exercise description](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?back=KataPacMan)

When the timer goes off reflect with the group. Consider the classes created. How many? How big? What mutable state? Consider the methods created How many? How long? Apply a few simple design metrics. How was the experience of working this way different from the usual? How could these ideas be applied in your day job?
