Long Intro

exercise at SPA 2015


We find that doing small exercises is valuable for learning and that programming together is
the best way to network for developers - what better way to get to know
each other and
fun.

## Gilded Rose Refactoring kata

I've used this exercise in courses, and recently in job interviews. I
didn't like it much at first, because it is 'easy' to refactor the code
in a direction that has not much of a design, but it has grown on me,
for reasons that you may find out doing it for yourself.

The overall goal is to add a new feature safely, which may involve
writing tests. 

Read the [Business
requirements](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose) , clone the
[legacy code in the language of your
choice](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata), and have fun!.

The goal of the exercise is not to rush to create a full solution, but
to work together in baby steps, working as well as you can. We do recommend that you use
version control, commit ridiculously often, and just revert if you get
stuck.

Since this is legacy code, the written requirements may not have all the
cases present in the actual code. Ensure you keep the behaviour the
system has now.

Have fun!
