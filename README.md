Long Intro
-----------
Exercise introduction and room layout for experimentel mass pairing
exercise at
/dev/summer conference.

We
find that doing small exercises is valuable for learning and that programming together is
the best way to network for developers - what better way to get to know
each other and
fun, so let's do it again :-).

We have five rooms, [choose a room](languages-rooms.md) with the
language you want to. The mass pairing session takes place from 13:35 to
14:20. Find someone you have not met, or at least programmed with,
before who also wants to program in the same language. It's probably easiest if one of you has
previous experience in your language of choice, but you can be more
daring if you want. Katas are a great way to explore new languages.

Mark Dalgarno and Willem van den Ende will be facilitating from the
hallway, and walking around the rooms making sure you
have fun, and maybe learn something :).

Around 14:05, put down your keyboards, stop, and have a look with other people
in the room at one or more outcomes. Look not just for the solution, but
the steps you took to get where you are and difficulties you encountered
along the way.

## Gilded Rose Refactoring kata

I've used this exercise in courses, and recently in job interviews. I
didn't like it much at first, because it is 'easy' to refactor the code
in a direction that has not much of a design, but it has grown on me,
for reasons that you may find out doing it for yourself.

The overall goal is to add a new feature safely, which may involve
writing tests. 

Read the [Business
requirements](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose) , clone the
[legacy code in the language of your
choice](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata), and have fun!.

The goal of the exercise is not to rush to create a full solution, but
to work together in baby steps, working as well as you can. We do recommend that you use
version control, commit ridiculously often, and just revert if you get
stuck.
